# Reverse-Engineering Methodology (Conceptual Verification)

This document summarizes the conceptual reverse-engineering procedure used to map the VR game's mechanics to the proposed framework.

## Steps
1. Expert triangulation meeting: lead researcher, game developer, reverse-engineering expert.
2. Functional decomposition: identify navigation, interactions, tasks, scoring, and logs.
3. Mapping: align game features to framework components (LA, PL, User Model, Behavior Model).
4. Identification of missing components and future extensions.
5. Documentation: mapping matrices, meeting notes, and alignment diagrams are provided.
